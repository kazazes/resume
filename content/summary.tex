\begin{cvparagraph}
Peter is a full stack developer and political strategist. His singular focus is developing full-stack, real-time data abstraction platforms focused on delivering positive social and organizational impact. When the data runs dry he brings the same focus to politics, first as a pollster, then child-pundit and campaign manager.

In 2012 he started Sibyl Vision, building frighteningly accurate predictive models for everything from commodities pricing to record sales. Sibyl grew to a sizable boutique data consultancy, working closely with many household names. Peter regularly spoke on Sibylâ€™s research.

Following the 2016 election, Peter shuttered Sibyl's political analysis practice and rebooted. He's spent the past two years architecting SkyScraper, radio capture hardware unearthing unexplored datasets. SkyScraper will be released as an open source OS in 2021.
 
Peter has learned all he (technically) knows on the job, and seeks to explore new domains. He has a strong preference for companies with a charter of social impact, but understands they are not in unlimited supply.
