\begin{cvparagraph}
Peter is an accomplished and proven political analyst, full stack developer, public speaker, and strategist. While he has worked across industries, his work seems to always come back to where it started - the intersection of politics and technology. Contract consulting in his early teens snowballed into the first social-media-sourced polling platform, Twelect, a massively popular public opinion monitoring tool during the 2012 presidential election. On the basis of Twelect's algorithmic technology, he created Sibyl Vision, a predict-anything public opinion analysis firm. He regularly spoke on Sibyl's research at universities and on national television.

As an engineer, his specialty is developing full-stack, real-time data abstraction platforms for a variety of industries, intent on exposing actionable business intelligence and consumer insight. He is passionate and professionally literate with regards to information security and related evolving policy.
